# ~/.wgetrc - Configuration file for the wget download utility
# Settings here define default behaviors unless overridden by command-line flags.

# --- Download & File Handling ---

# `timestamping = on`
# If the server provides a "Last-Modified" timestamp for a file, wget will compare
# it to the local file's timestamp (if it exists). If the local file is newer or
# the same age, wget won't re-download it. Essential for mirroring or updating.
timestamping = on

# `no_parent = on`
# When downloading recursively (`-r`, `-m`), prevent wget from ascending to the
# parent directory of the starting URL. This is a safety measure to avoid
# downloading unexpected parts of a website (e.g., going from /dir/subdir/ to /dir/).
no_parent = on

# `trust_server_names = on`
# If a download involves redirections, wget will try to use the filename from the
# *final* URL in the redirection chain, rather than the original URL.
trust_server_names = on

# `content_disposition = on`
# Honor the `Content-Disposition` HTTP header sent by the server. Servers often use
# this header to suggest a more appropriate filename for the download, especially
# for dynamically generated content. Often used together with `trust_server_names`.
content_disposition = on

# `adjust_extension = on`
# If a downloaded file has a Content-Type of `text/html` or `application/xhtml+xml`
# but its filename lacks `.html` or `.htm`, wget will add `.html`. Similarly, it
# adds `.css` for `text/css` files. Useful for local viewing.
adjust_extension = on

# --- Connection & Retries ---

# `timeout = 60`
# Set the timeout duration (in seconds) for various network operations (DNS lookup,
# connecting, reading data). The default read timeout is very long (900s/15min).
# 60 seconds is often a more practical default.
timeout = 60

# `tries = 3`
# Set the number of times wget should retry a download if it fails (e.g., due to
# network errors, timeouts). The default is 20, which can be excessive. 3 is usually enough.
tries = 3

# `retry_connrefused = on`
# If a connection attempt fails specifically because the server refused it
# (connection refused error), wget will still retry according to the `tries` setting.
# Useful if a server is temporarily overloaded or restarting.
retry_connrefused = on

# --- Protocol Behavior ---

# `follow_ftp = off`
# By default, wget will *not* follow FTP links found within downloaded HTML pages.
# Set to `on` only if you specifically need this behavior.
follow_ftp = off

# `robots = off`
# **Use with caution.** This setting tells wget to completely ignore the `robots.txt`
# file and any `<meta name="robots" content="nofollow">` tags found on websites.
# `robots.txt` is the standard way website owners request automated crawlers (like wget)
# not to access certain parts of their site. Ignoring it can put unnecessary load
# on servers or access private areas. Only use `robots = off` if you are sure you
# have permission or are intentionally archiving something where respecting robots.txt
# would prevent success, and understand the ethical implications.
# The default, more polite behavior is `robots = on`.
robots = off

# --- Output & Logging ---

# `server_response = on`
# Print the full HTTP or FTP server response headers before the download begins.
# This is very useful for debugging redirects, content types, cookies, errors, etc.
# It can make the output quite verbose for simple downloads. Comment out if not needed often.
server_response = on

# --- File Rejection ---

# `reject = <list>`
# Define a comma-separated list of file extensions (or filename patterns) that wget
# should *not* download, primarily during recursive (`-r`, `-m`) operations.
# Useful for skipping large media files, archives, executables, etc.
# Customize this list based on your common needs.
reject = exe,zip,dmg,pkg,7z,rar,iso,msi # Example: Common executables, installers, archives
# reject = pdf,mp3,mp4,avi,mov,jpg,png # Example: Common documents/media

# --- Settings Usually Set Per-Command (Examples - Commented Out) ---
# These options configure behaviors that are often better controlled via command-line
# flags for specific download tasks, but you can set defaults here if desired.

# Set the maximum recursion depth for `wget -r`. Default is 5 levels deep.
## reclevel = 3

# Define a default directory prefix where *all* downloaded files will be saved.
# The default is the current working directory where wget is run.
## dir_prefix = ~/Downloads/wget_files

# Set a default number of parallel download connections for recursive downloads.
# The default is 1 (sequential downloads). Increasing this can speed things up
# but puts significantly more load on the server. Use responsibly.
## concurrent = 5

# Define a default User-Agent string. Some websites block the default `Wget/...`
# agent. Mimicking a browser can help but use ethically.
## user_agent = Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
